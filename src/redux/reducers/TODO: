TODO:

make google app with email ngoy.apps@gmail.com
add it to django admin page
create log in with google button and link it properly

create log in with facebook button and link it properly

figure out social logout
allauth.facebook.logout() should do the trick for facebook?
accounts/logout is an api endpoint as well i think

----
once we have login and logout, the next thing to do is to make a customer user info and tie it to our default django users

def get_by_natural_key(self):
       return self.username
class UserManager(models.Manager):
   def get_by_natural_key(self):
       return self.username

 is a place to start looking for that

 ----

 once we have custom user info (that should probably be stored in state)
 we can start to work on making our tables nice 
 (ant table)


 -------------------
 when a user logs in, they get redirected to the main page. have the main page call the get user session token!! then pass it over to the navbar!!
